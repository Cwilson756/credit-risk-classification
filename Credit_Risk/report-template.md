## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a model to accurately predict if a loan will be 0 - healthy loan or a 1 - high risk loan. The data provided was lending data including the following rows: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, num of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. We were trying to predict the total number of healthy and high risk loans there were through value_counts, splitting the lending data provided into training and test data. We then built predictions around the training data using a Logistical Regression Model to predict if a loan will be healthy or high risk. We did this once with the scaled data, and once with an oversampling libary to expand the avalible data to the model. We then confirmed the accuracy of these models using accuracy scores, confusing matrix analysis, and classification reports.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
